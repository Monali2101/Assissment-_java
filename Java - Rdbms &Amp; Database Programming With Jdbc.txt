THEORY QUESTION:-

Q1.		What is JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)?

Ans		JDBC is an API (Application Programming Interface) in Java that allows programs to connect to and interact with databases 			using SQL queries.

Q2.		Importance of JDBC in Java Programming?

Ans		Enables communication between Java applications and databases.
		Allows data storage, retrieval, and manipulation from Java programs.
		Supports different databases (like MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server) using database drivers.
		Makes Java applications database-independent.

Q3.		JDBC Architecture: Driver Manager, Driver, Connection, Statement, and ResultSet?

Ans		Driver Manager – Manages a list of database drivers and connects Java applications to the correct database driver.
		Driver – Translates Java commands into database-specific calls.
		Connection – Represents an active link between the Java program and the database.
		Statement – Used to execute SQL queries (like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
		ResultSet – Holds the data returned by a SELECT query, allowing row-by-row access.

Q4.		 Overview of JDBC Driver Types: 
		 Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver 
		Type 2: Native-API Driver 
		Type 3: Network Protocol Driver 
		Type 4: Thin Driver
		Comparison and Usage  of Each Driver Type

Ans		Type 1: JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver
		Uses ODBC driver to connect to the database.
		Advantage: Easy to use for testing.
		Disadvantage: Slower performance, requires ODBC installation.
		Usage: Outdated, rarely used now.

		Type 2: Native-API Driver
		Uses native database client libraries (C/C++) to connect.
		Advantage: Faster than Type 1.
		Disadvantage: Platform dependent.
		Usage: Used when native libraries are available.

		Type 3: Network Protocol Driver
		Uses a middle-tier server to communicate with the database.
		Advantage: Platform independent, good for web applications.
		Disadvantage: Requires an additional server layer.
		Usage: Suitable for large network-based systems.

		Type 4: Thin Driver
		Pure Java driver that connects directly to the database using TCP/IP.
		Advantage: Platform independent, fast, and widely used.
		Usage: Common in modern JDBC applications.

Q5.		Step-by-Step Process to Establish a JDBC Connection:
		1. Import the JDBC packages
		2. Register the JDBC driver
		3. Open a connection to the database
		4. Create a statement
		5. Execute SQL queries
		6. Process the result set
		7. Close the connection

Ans		Import the JDBC packages:
		import java.sql.*;
		Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
		Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dbname", "user", "password");
		Statement stmt = con.createStatement();
		ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM students");
		while (rs.next()) {
  			 System.out.println(rs.getString("student_name"));
		}
		con.close();

Q6.		Overview of JDBC Statements: 
		Statement: Executes simple SQL queries without parameters. 
		 PreparedStatement: Precompiled SQL statements for queries with parameters. 
		CallableStatement: Used to call stored procedures.
		Differences between Statement, PreparedStatement, and
		CallableStatement

Ans		| Type                  | Description                                    				          | Example Use                           			          | Characteristics                    
| Statement       	              | Executes simple SQL queries without parameters. | `SELECT * FROM table;`                                       | Slower for repeated queries.       
| PreparedStatement     | Used for precompiled queries with parameters.      | `INSERT INTO students VALUES (?, ?);`          | Faster, prevents SQL injection.    
| CallableStatement        | Used to call stored procedures in the database.      | `CALL getStudentData(?);`                                  | Useful for complex business logic. 


Q7.		 Insert: Adding a new record to the database. 
		Update: Modifying existing records. 
		Select: Retrieving records from the database. 
		Delete: Removing records from the database.

Ans		| Operation  | Purpose                 	 	  | SQL Example                                             
		| INSERT  	| Add a new record.            | `INSERT INTO students (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Monali');` 
		| UPDATE 	| Modify existing records. | `UPDATE students SET name='Patel' WHERE id=1;`          
		| SELECT 	| Retrieve records.              | `SELECT * FROM students;`                               
		| DELETE	| Remove records.               | `DELETE FROM students WHERE id=1;`        

Q8.		 What is ResultSet in JDBC?

Ans		ResultSet is an object in JDBC that stores the data returned after executing a SELECT query.
		It acts like a table in memory, where you can read data row by row.

Q9. 		Navigating through ResultSet (first, last, next, previous)

Ans		You can move the cursor in a ResultSet using navigation methods:
		rs.next() → Moves to the next row.
		rs.previous() → Moves to the previous row.
		rs.first() → Moves to the first row.
		rs.last() → Moves to the last row.

Q10.	 Working with ResultSet to retrieve data from SQL queries

Ans		ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT id, name FROM students");
		while (rs.next()) {
    		int id = rs.getInt("id");
   		String name = rs.getString("name");
   		System.out.println(id + " - " + name);
		}


Q11.	 What is DatabaseMetaData?

Ans		DatabaseMetaData is an interface in JDBC that provides information about the database —
		 such as its structure, version, tables, and supported features.

Q12.	Importance of Database Metadata in JDBC

Ans		Database metadata helps developers to:
		Understand database structure (tables, columns).
		Check database version and driver details.
		Build dynamic SQL applications that adapt to different databases.

Q13.	Methods provided by DatabaseMetaData (getDatabaseProductName, getTables, etc.)

Ans		getDatabaseProductName() → Returns the name of the database.
		getDatabaseProductVersion() → Returns the database version.
		getDriverName() → Returns the JDBC driver name.
		getTables(null, null, "%", null) → Returns all table names.
		getUserName() → Returns the current username.

Q14.	What is ResultSetMetaData?

Ans		ResultSetMetaData is an interface that provides information about the structure of a ResultSet,
		 such as the number of columns, column names, and data types.

Q15.	Importance of ResultSet Metadata in analyzing the structure of query results

Ans		Dynamically analyze query results without knowing table structure in advance.
		Display column names and data types in applications (e.g., reports).
		Work with generic queries that adapt to any table.

Q16.	Methods in ResultSetMetaData (getColumnCount, getColumnName, getColumnType) 

Ans		ResultSetMetaData rsmd = rs.getMetaData();
		int cols = rsmd.getColumnCount();
		for (int i = 1; i <= cols; i++) {
 		   System.out.println(rsmd.getColumnName(i) + " - " + rsmd.getColumnTypeName(i));
		}
